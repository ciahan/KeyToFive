                                In freshman year, I was trying to find resources for my APUSH class
                                (anybody who took it knows how many acts there were!). However, as I tried to
                                scour the internet for free notes, I was constantly blocked by paywalls.

                                with months-long wait times.

                                and I have been writing notes for all of the different APs that we took, from
                                AP Gov to AP Bio. I would often share these notes to Discord servers, with the
                                hope that some students would be able to find these resources helpful in their
                                own journey.

                                During the summer of junior year, I realized that something could be done to
                                help make these notes available to all students across the world. Students that
                                couldn’t afford textbooks or resources could use our notes and become successful
                                exam takers. That was how the idea of <span className="highlight-text">keytofive.org</span> started.

                                Of course, we needed help to help make this project successful. We recruited our
                                friends and also students that we met along our academic journeys to help with
                                our mission of making AP exam success achievable for all.

                            We truly believe that financial barriers shouldn't determine students’ access to
                            resources. Key to Five exists to break these barriers and give all students the
                            opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background.
